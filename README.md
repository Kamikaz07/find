# Find - Marketplace Application

This is a Next.js application for a marketplace platform where users can create, view, and manage advertisements.

## Features

- Public page with all advertisements
- User dashboard for authenticated users
- Create, edit, and delete advertisements
- Search advertisements by keyword
- Authentication with NextAuth.js
- Image upload and management with Cloudinary

## Cloudinary Integration

This application uses Cloudinary for image storage and management. Follow these steps to set up Cloudinary for your environment:

### 1. Create a Cloudinary Account

1. Sign up for a free account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. After signing up, you'll be provided with your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add your Cloudinary credentials to the `.env.local` file:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

Replace `your_cloud_name`, `your_api_key`, and `your_api_secret` with the values from your Cloudinary dashboard.

### 3. Verify Configuration

To verify that Cloudinary is properly configured, you can use the included test script:

```bash
node src/scripts/test-cloudinary.js
```

This script will check if your Cloudinary credentials are valid and if the connection to Cloudinary's API is working.

You can also verify the configuration by:

1. Starting the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the "Criar An√∫ncio" page
3. Uploading an image when creating a new advertisement
4. If the image uploads successfully and appears in the advertisement, Cloudinary is properly configured
